Various iterations of our car bracket made in blender can be found here for reference and version control.

The car bracket was made to fit competition restraints of 15cm length x 7.5cm width x 5cm height.

Version notes:
- Version 3 had several non-manifold geometry issues
- Version 4 was more polished however still had geometry issues
- Version 7 fixes all geometry issues, is to scale for 3d printing, and includes a full model of the arduino smart car chassis that was converted from a .stp file to .stl through fusion.

Version 7 estimations:

The estimate enough was taken with a grain of salt as this was our first experience with 3D printing and we needed to find a good ratio between the infill and layer height to ensure a lightweight stable bracket on the chassis.
